A player can place a cell on an empty field. They can also place it on a field that already contains their own cells, increasing that cell's mass. Once a cell has reached critical mass (at least as much as the number of neighboring fields around it), it splits into the neighboring fields, converting the opponents' cells into own cells if any happened to be there. The game is finished once only a single player's cells remain on the board, at which point that player is declared the winner.</p><p>If you've never played the game before though, it might be easier to understand the rules by giving it a try. Feel free to make a move on the board below! Your cells will be red circles, while your opponent's cells will be blue stars. The opponent is a computer that simply makes a move on a random available spot on the board.</p><div id="mount--demo"></div><a href="simulator.html">Open full simulator</a></main></body></html>
