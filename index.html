A player can place a cell on an empty field. They can also place it on a field that already contains their own cells, increasing that cell's mass. Once a cell has reached critical mass (at least as much as the number of neighboring fields around it), it splits into the neighboring fields, converting the opponents' cells into own cells if any happened to be there. The game is finished once only a single player's cells remain on the board, at which point that player is declared the winner.</p><p>If you've never played the game before though, it might be easier to understand the rules by giving it a try. Feel free to make a move on the board below! Your cells will be red circles, while your opponent's cells will be blue stars. The opponent is a computer that simply makes a move on a random available spot on the board.</p><div id="mount--demo"></div><p>The game is easy to follow on a small board. However, it gets hectic fast when playing on a larger one. It often happens that players on the verge of defeat, having only a couple of fields with their own cells, end up winning the game by getting a lucky chain reaction that ends up consuming everyone else on the board.</p><p>The volatile nature of the game lead to the question: "Is there an optimal strategy for winning?" This web app serves as a playground to compare strategies.</p><p>Now that you understand the rules of the game, you can <a href="simulator.html">open the game simulator</a> and have different strategies battle each other on the board.</p></main><body><div id="app"></div></body></body></html>
